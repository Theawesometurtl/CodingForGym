         <p>One of the simplest ways to eat healthy is to keep track of the nutrition of the food you eat.
            There is a nutrition facts section on all packaged foods that tells you the calorie count, fat, carbs,
             salt (sodium), protein, and vitamins/minerals that the food product contains in one serving. Try keeping
             track of the nutrients you consume daily and check if there are any you aren't getting enough of.
             Each facts section will give you the daily value of the particular nutrient per serving,
             it is useful to look and see approximately how much of that nutrient you need daily, but remember
             everyone is different and has different food needs. What is healthy for you might not be healthy for
             someone else, and vice versa. It may be worth it to keep track of foods you need to avoid because of
             health reasons or otherwise. Also, check the ingredients section and see if there are many ingredients
             you don't recognize. If the ingredients section looks like it belongs on a chemistry exam, that is a 
             pretty good sign it isn't healthy.

         <div class="subtitle"><h2>Be Wary of Proccessed Foods</h2> 
         <br>

         <br>
         <p>While there is nothing inherently bad about proccessed foods, they are created in bulk in factories
            and are usually engineered to be tasty while using cheap ingredients with little nutritional value.
            Because it isn't an option to completely avoid all proccessed foods, try limiting your consumption of 
            them in favour of healthier, fresher foods.

         <div class="subtitle"><h2>Watch Out for Fad Diets</h2> <br></div>
         <p>A fad diet is any diet that makese unreasonable health claims not backed up by research that
            becomes extremely popular for a short duration of time.<br> The main signs a diet is a fad diet are 
            as follows: <br><br>
            You lose/gain weight over short periods of time- this can be an unhealthy behavior that can lower
            your metabolism and make you gain more weight back in the long run. <br><br>
            The diet is restrictive- humans need a variety of foods to stay healthy and also need to consume a
            certain amount of calories. Restrictions on calorie intake and food groups is a sign of a fad diet
