            <h2>Posititive Association</h2>
         </div>
         <p>There are many methods of positive association, where big brands try to associate their brand with
            positive ideas to increase the likelyhood you will buy their products. Below are a few methods of 
            positive association.

            <h2>Apealing to Your Senses</h2>

         </div>
         <p>Most food advertisements have some aspect of this in them, the giant bite into an overflowing big mac,
             the telltale crack and sizzle of opening a can of pop, or some other slow-motion shot of food floating
             through the air. This is an obvious advertising tactic that works. Whenever I see a poster for fast 
             food, my mouth waters thinking about how it must taste. Advertisements like this can be misleading 
             as to how good the food actually is.

            <h2>Animals + Other Unrelated Things</h2>

         </div>
         <p>Frosted Flakes commercials always have a tiger in them. Why? The tiger has nothing to do with the
            cereal itself. It all has to do with what the tiger makes you feel. Tigers remind me of strength,
            independence, and nature. Even though the tiger and the cereal are two completely different things, 
            when we see them together we associate the two as a heuristic or shortcut meaning every time we think 
            of the cereal we are more likely to think of a tiger and the associations that come with a tiger.

            <h2>Celebrity Influencers</h2>

         </div>
         <p>Sometimes companies will pay a celebrity to endorse and promote their product. This works in
            several ways. Having a celebrity support them makes them look better in the eyes
            of the public, as long as the celebrity is liked. Also, celebrities are often seen 
            as role models, so if you want to want to become more like a specific celebrity, you 
            might also want to drink the same pop they drink, or eat the same donuts they eat. 
            You like Justin Bieber, so you also like Tim Hortons.
