         <p>Big companies use many strategies to get you to consume their products, ranging from creating 
            exciting advertisements that appeal to your senses, to placing their product in a frequently
             used part of a store. If humans were rational we wouldn't fall prey to any marketing strategies,
             but unfortunately humans aren't rational, and everyone, including you, are influenced by the flashy
             ads and product placement
         </p>
         <p>Learning about food marketing is important because understanding the ways big companies get you to consume different
         foods can help you recognize when these tactics are working on you or others. It can help you make informed food 
         choices that are best for you.
